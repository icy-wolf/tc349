	<h2>My Semester Project Card Sorting Results</h2>
	<p>For my project that I will be working on the rest of the semester will be a personal website for me to show off the web development skills I learn in this class. It will have sections like Academic Career, About Me, Work, Project etc. I hope to be able to use this site when I go looking for internships or jobs later down the line.</p>

		<h3>My Results</h3>

		</table>
		<p>In mycard sort, I had big sections such as About Me, Work, Projects and Academic Career. About me would hold personal things like my past high schools, my family and my interests. My work would hold all my work experience in which I would talk about my past jobs. Projects has it's own heading because I want to highlight the projects I did outside of class to employers. My Academic Career more focuses on my oragaizations and professional development events that I have attended. It doesn't really focus on the places I attened school so I put those in About Me. My Goals heading I proabaly won't keep but at the time I was thinking that I had a past, present kind of theme that I would want a future section too. Thus Goals.</p>

		<h3>James' Results</h3>

			<tr>
				<td><img src="images/JamesProjStart.jpg"></td>
				<td><img src="images/JamesProjFinish.jpg"></td>
			</tr>
		</table>
		<p>My friend James had three main headings: Education, Work and About Me. His reasoning was to place my past educational institutes, my courses and my clubs in the same heading. WHis work category was the same as mine and he put everything else in About Me. He said that my interests, family, places traveled and projects were all about me in the fact of personal interest, instead of putthing them by thmemselves or under education (if applied). He did not use my goals sections as he deemed it unnecessary.</p>

		<h3>Amy's Results</h3>
		<table border="0" align="center">
			<tr>
				<td><img src="images/AmyProjStart.jpg"></td>
				<td><img src="images/AmyProjFinish.jpg"></td>
			</tr>
		</table>
		<p>My roommate Amy, had a different apporach. She had About Me, Academic Career, Work, Projects and Goals as her main headings. She put my interests and family under About Me because she said that was person content. The Academic Career could then be broken up into three parts: Clubs, Education, and Events Attended. Work was the same as James' and my card sort. She also had Projects highlighted and did actually use the Goal section saying it was a good way to show the future of my person site.</p>

		<h3>Coryn's Results</h3>
		<table border="0" align="center">
			<tr>
				<td><img src="images/CorynProjStart.jpg"></td>
				<td><img src="images/CorynProjFinish.jpg"></td>
			</tr>
		</table>
		<p>Coryn had a very spaced out apporached giving Places Traveled, Events Attended, Clubs, Work, Projects, About Me, Education and Academic Career their own heading. This only left a little content under each one. It's a very spaced out way of laying the website out versus James' layout, which is more deep.</p>
