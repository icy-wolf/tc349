	<h2>NASA'S Moon Website Card Sorting Results</h2>
	<p>Visiting NASA's Moon Website, I was able to capture the elements of the page and put them onto cards. I then sorted them into how I thought the site should be organized. I gathered my friends and asked them to do a sort of their own of the same content. These are my results.</p>
	<section>
		<h3>My Results</h3>
		<table border="0" align="center">
			<tr>
				<td><img src="images/NicoleNASAStart.jpg"></td>
				<td><img src="images/NicoleNASAFinish.jpg"></td>
			</tr>
		</table>
		<p>In comparison to the actual NASA website I kept some of the same design such as the About the Moon, News and Events and Missions headers. But I added a section About NASA which includes the people apart of NASA and the Inspector General. I also added a section called Legalities which is all the legal policies and acts listed on their site. I also kept the sites partners header and listed all the partners and organizations from their site. So I kept a few things the same but I added a few new sections and switched some stuff around.</p>

		<h3>James' Results</h3>
		<table border="0" align="center">
			<tr>
				<td><img src="images/JamesNASAStart.jpg"></td>
				<td><img src="images/JamesNASAFinish.jpg"></td>
			</tr>
		</table>
		<p>James completely redesigned the site. His biggest header was About NASA with About the Moon, NASA Visitor Center, Legalities Partners, Features and the Mission Direcorites. Each header had one if not two sub headings. Features had the most sub headings. His apporach is more deep and not as wide spread.</p>

		<h3>Amy's Results</h3>
		<table border="0" align="center">
			<tr>
				<td><img src="images/AmyNASAStart.jpg"></td>
				<td><img src="images/AmyNASAFinish.jpg"></td>
			</tr>
		</table>
		<p>Amy's design was fairly wide spread with headings like Partners, Media, Legalities, About the Moon, About NASA, Missions and Get Invovled. There were no sub headings under any of the headings and she actually didn't use Features, Concepts, People or Products.</p>
	</section>
	<section>
		<h3>Coryn's Results</h3>
		<table border="0" align="center">
			<tr>
				<td><img src="images/CorynNASAStart.jpg"></td>
				<td><img src="images/CorynNASAFinish.jpg"></td>
			</tr>
		</table>
		<p>Coryn also had a semi wide spread apporach. She had a lot of the items in different places than the original website though. She kept Media the same but added parts to About the Moon that were originally in News and Events. She has a large Get Involved section and had the same Legality idea I did with all the policies and acts. She also didn't use the concepts, feature or product cards.</p>
