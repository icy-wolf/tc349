		<h3>Portfolio</h3>
			<p>In any spare time outside of class, I like to work on small projects where I can explore the techniques and concepts we've learned in class. I have created a very basic website for another class two years ago which is what got me interested in web development. As for programming, I have made a Truth or Dare game in python as a reseult from my python class I took last semester.</p>

Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book. It has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into electronic typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged.</p>
